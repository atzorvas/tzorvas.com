| At last, no wordpress for me.
| So this is something new, I am tinkering with **Pelican**, as a new solution for my personal page.
| And for sure i have a lot of changes into my todo list for this "project". So if you have any idea just send me an email, for now.

| **My current setup**
| Pelican_ with the default *notmyidea* theme.
| Disqus_ for the comments
| Sublime-text2_ with sublime-pelican_
| sshfs_ for mounting the FS and editing remotely the files with sublime-text2.
| 
| Github Ribbon added, now you can clone the source code.
